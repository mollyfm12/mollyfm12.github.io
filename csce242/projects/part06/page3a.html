                    <p id="budapest-p">Budapest was the first city outside of Italy I traveled to. I visited March 1st through March 3rd. We had a really long travel day getting there. We took an overnight train, but we accidentally booked 3 change of trains, so it was a very tiring travel journey. The first train was very cool: it looked like something out of Hogwarts. By the time we got there, we checked into our Airbnb and got breakfast. We went to a cafe and it had very American breakfast options. I got an avocado toast rendition and a cappuchino. </p>
