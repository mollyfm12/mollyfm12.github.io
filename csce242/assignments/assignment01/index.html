        <h1>Molly's Recipes</h1>
        <p>This website will be a collective journal of recipes I have learned to make. I started cooking in 2020 during Covid due to boredom, but I have come to love it. I love learning new flavor profiles and new techniques from many different cultures of food. There will be a variety of cooking styles, meal options, and cuisines!</p>

            <li>Dinner Recipes</li>
            <p>Dinner recipes will often consist of a carb and a protein. Most commonly I cook many Italian dinner recipes which focus on a pasta and a protein. I have also loved learning about many asian dishes that will be included. I'm excited to dive deeper into these. </p>
